Currently a student from UNLP. While I'm learning the basics about programming in college, in my free time I'll be learning how to code in other languages.

<p>
In this moment I'm focusing mostly in my first year. I want to build a good base to start with and then move on to more complex concepts and projects. I don't like to rush things and I use to enjoy learning anythingg that is presented, so, I'm sure I'll be succeeding eventually.
